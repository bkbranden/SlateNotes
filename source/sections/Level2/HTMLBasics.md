## Introduction to HTML

* Whole web platform never broke backwards compatability
* Very simple and forgiving

## HTML Basics

* HTML is served to the browser in several ways:
    * Can be generated by server-side application and build it depending on request or session data
        * Ex. Rails, Laravel, or Django application
    * Can be generated by Javascript client-side application on the fly
    * Stored in a file and served to a browser by a web server
* HTML is saved in .html files
* HTML content is organized using tags
    * Ex. ```<p> Some text </p>```
* The browser interprets these tags and then presents them in a basic way
    * There is no styling done by the browser without CSS
    * HTML is more concerned with how things are structured rather than how they look

### HTML Page Structure

* HTML starts with the document type declaration (doctype)
    * Ex. ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
* Then have the html element to wrap all the tags
    * Ex. 
    ``` 
       <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            ...
        </html>
    ```
* Tags can either come in pairs as a opening and closing tag
    * Ex. ```<p>Some Text</p>```
* Tags can also be self-closing, meaning that it cannot contain any text in between it
    * Ex. ```<img src="" />```
* In the HTML tag, there is a HEAD and BODY
    * Ex. 
    ``` 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                ...
            </head>
            <body>
                ...
            </body>
        </html>
    ```
* The head contains tags that are essential to creating a webpage
    * Title
    * Metadata
    * CSS / JS links
    * Generally the head contains information that is not visible
* The body contains the actual content that is visible

### Tags vs Elements

* Tag is the type of element and the element is the whole package for that piece of the HTML page
* Elements have a starting tag and closing tag
    * Starting tag
    * Text element
    * Closing tag

### Attributes

* Starting tags can have attributes in a "key:value" pair orientation that add additional information to the tag
    * Ex. ```<p class="a-class">Some Text</p>```
* Common tags are:
    * Class - identify HTML elements by a certain class, can have multiple separated by spaces
    * Id - identify HTML elements by an Id, this has to be unique within the whole HTML document

### White Space

* In HTML, the browser parses out all of the whitespace for the content within tags
    * Ex. ```<p>A paragraph of text</p>```
    is the same as ```<p>_____ A paragraph of text</p>```
    * "_" is a space
* Use CSS property: white-space to change this

## Document Heading

* Head tag defines elements that define the document properties
* Always written before the document body tag

### Tags

* Title
    * Determines the page title, what is displayed on the browser tab
    * Helps in SEO
* Script
    * Used to add Javascript into the page
    * Can be included inline or referring to an external JS file
    * Type attribute is set to text/javascript by default
    * Script should always be in the head tag and need to add "defer" attribute to make sure that the content loads before the Javascript
* Noscript
    * Tag used to detect if Javascript is disabled
    * If used in head, it can include link, style, and meta tags that are served if javascript is disabled
    * In the body, it can be used to render HTML elements if javascript is disabled
* Link
    * Tag used to set relationships between a document and other resources
    * Mainly used to link CSS stylesheets
    * Can also link to other resources than stylesheets
        * Ex. ```<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/index.xml">```
    * Can also link to favicons and load different style sheets based on the device
* Style
    * Used to add styling into the document without the use of an external stylesheet
* Meta
    * Tag used for SEO
    * Can be used for description of the page which is what Google uses to display page information
        * Ex. ```<meta name="description" content="Content">```
    * Robots attribute tag allows the file to tell the search engines whether they should index the file, follow links on the page, etc. 
    * The Viewport attribute can tell the browser to set the page width based on the device width

## Document Body

* Document body contains the elements that define the content of the document

### Block vs Inline Elements

* HTML elements are split into 2 types:
    * Block
        * When positioned in the page, it does not let any elements be next to that element to the left or right
        * These elements "stack" on top of each other
    * Inline
        * Can sit next to each other and also within block elements
* CSS styling properties are different for both as well
    * Block can have their height, width, margin, etc. changed but inline cannot
* Block elements can contain other block elements but inline elements cannot contain other inline or block elements

## Text Elements

### p tag

* ```<p> Some Text </p>```
* Stands for paragraph element
* Cannot contain other paragraph elements or block elements, but can contain inline elements

### span tag

* ```<span> Some Text </span>```
* Inline element that is used within block elements to target using CSS attributes

### br tag

* ```<p> Some text <br> A new line </p>```
* This tag is an inline element that represents a line break

### heading tags

* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
* ```<h1> Some Text </h1>```
* Headings are used for structuring the information of the page as h1 is most important and h6 is least important
* Also utilized in SEOs
* Are block elements that cannot contain any other elements except text

### Code Blocks

* Code and pre tags
* ```<pre><code> Some Code </code></pre>```
* Code elements are wrapped with pre tags because the code element ignores whitespace and line breaks

### Lists

* 3 types of lists:
    1. Unordered List
    2. Ordered List
    3. Definition Lists
* Unordered lists are creating using ```<ul>```tag
    * Ex.
    ```
    <ul>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
    </ul>
    ```
* Ordered lists are the same but uses ```<ol>``` tag
    * Ex.
    ```
    <ol>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
    </ol>
    ```
* Definition lists are different in that it has a term and definition
    * Ex.
    ```
    <dl>
        <dt>Flavio</dt>
        <dd>The name</dd>
        <dt>Copes</dt>
        <dd>The surname</dd>
    </dl>
    ```

## Links

* Defined using the ```<a>``` tag
* The destination of the link is set by the "href" attribute
    * Ex. ```<a href="https://flaviocopes.com">click here</a>```
* Links work with relative URLs but have a slight nuance
    * If there is "/" prepended to the beginning of the path, the browser replaces all of the string starting from the origin with that path
        * Ex. ```<a href="/test">click here</a>``` brings you to http://url/test if u were on http://url/other/
    * If there is no "/" prepended, it adds the string on top of the current path
        * Ex. ```<a href="test">click here</a>``` brings you to http://url/other/test if you were on http://url/other/

## Container Tags / Page Structure

* These tags are used to separate the sections of the document into structured areas
* The main ones used are:
    * article
    * section
    * div
    * nav
    * aside
    * header
    * main
    * footer
* article is used to specify a section can be independent from the other sections
    * Inside should have h1-h6 tag and content
* section is used to specify a section of the document
    * Inside should have a heading tag (h1-h6) and the body
* div is the most popular one which is a generic container element
    * Often paired with class and id attributes to use for styling

## Forms

* Forms are the way that you send requests and interact with a page for HTML
* By default, sending a form will take you to another URL or reload the page, but this can be mitigated using libraries or AJAX
* Forms have an "action" and "method" attribute to determine what type of request and where the request is going
    * Ex.
    ``` 
    <form action="/new-contact" method="POST">
	    ...
    </form>
    ```
    * Forms need some sort of server-side logic to handle the request from the client
    * The above example takes the user to /new-contact on the same origin
    * If the origin (domain + protocol + port) was http://flaviocopes.com, it will take you to http://flaviocopes.com/new-contact
* The data in the form is structured using ```<input>``` elements
    * There are a lot of types of input elements, but the most common ones are:
        * Text: ```<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Your username">```
        * Email: ```<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">```
        * Password: ```<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Your password">```
* For form validation on the client side, one option is to add the "required" attribute to input elements that have to be filled out, or use the type of input to enforce a specific format
    * Ex. if input is of type "email" the browser checks that there is a properly formatted email before sending the request

## Tables

* Define tables using ```<table>``` tag
* Inside tables are ```<tr>``` tags for rows
* Inside rows are ```<td>``` tags for columns
* The first row can have header content which is different by using ```<th>``` tags for the columns
* Ex.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1 Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1 Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1 Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2 Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2 Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2 Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Rows can span over multiple columns using the "colspan" attribute
* Rows can span over multiple rows by using the "rowspan" attribute
* Ex.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">Rows 1-2 Columns 1-2</td>
    <td>Row 1 Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2 Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* For row headings, you can add a ```<th>``` tag to the first element inside a ```<tr>``` that is not the first ```<tr>``` of the table
* Ex. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Row 1</th>
    <td>Col 2</td>
    <td>Col 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Row 2</th>
    <td>Col 2</td>
    <td>Col 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Can have additional tags to organize the table:
    * thead
    * tbody
    * tfoot
* Ex.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Column 2</th>
      <th>Column 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Row 1</th>
      <td>Col 2</td>
      <td>Col 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Row 2</th>
      <td>Col 2</td>
      <td>Col 3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Footer of Col 1</td>
      <td>Footer of Col 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

* The ```<caption>``` element right after ```<table>``` can be used to give a caption to the table

## Multimedia Elements

* You can have ```<audio>``` and ```<video>``` elements to include audio and video clips
* These have specific attributes such as "controls", "autoplay", "loop", etc. to control the functionality of the multimedia when it loads

## Iframe

* The iframe tag allows for embedding content from other sites into the document (other origins)
* Creates a new nested browsing context, meaning anything in the iframe cannot leak towards the parent document
* Ex. Codepen, Glitch, and other sites that allow you to code in one part of the page uses iframes.

## Images

* Displayed using the ```<img>``` tag
* Element accepts a "src" attribute that determines the image source
    * Can be any format for images
    * Ex. JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG
* Requires an "alt" attribute for the alternate text that is shown if the image fails to load
    * Also used by SEO bots
